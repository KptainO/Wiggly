Wiggly
======

(URL) Routing library. No need to build your urls and extract their data by hand anymore!

## Wiggly lets you

- Create url patterns
- Generate those urls based on input arguments
- Even faster: generate urls matching your model objects (TODO)
- Extract parameters from incoming urls
- Define requirements on each incoming/outgoing parameters
- Build a collection of urls that you can easily reference (TODO)

For more explanation, see the [wiki](/wiki)
